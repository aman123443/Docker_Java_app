				"Title: Introduction to Containerization and Application Deployment using Docker\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Objective: To understand the fundamentals of containerization by packaging a Java Spring Boot web application into a Docker image, running it as a container, and exposing it to the local machine.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"## Summary of Implementation\n" +
				"The experiment was successfully conducted in a series of steps. First, a simple \"Hello World\" web application was created using the Java Spring Boot framework. A Dockerfile was then written in the project's root directory to provide instructions for building a container image. This Dockerfile utilized a multi-stage build process to create an optimized, lightweight final image.\n" +
				"\n" +
				"Using the Docker CLI, the docker build command was executed to create the image from the Dockerfile. After a successful build, the docker run command was used to start a container from the newly created image. During this process, a common port conflict was encountered because another service (Jenkins) was already using the target port (8080).\n" +
				"\n" +
				"The conflict was resolved by modifying the docker run command to map the container to a different host port (8081), demonstrating a practical troubleshooting step. Finally, the application was successfully accessed via a web browser, confirming that the containerized application was running correctly.";
